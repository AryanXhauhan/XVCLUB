**Priya Sharma** is a beauty consultant who's spent the last 8 years navigating the chaotic world of Indian beauty. What started as a personal quest to find makeup that wouldn't melt off in Mumbai's humidity turned into helping thousands of women across India discover products that actually work for our skin.

Her journey began in 2016 when, frustrated with international brands that left her looking orange or ashy, she started testing every affordable Indian brand she could find. "I wasted so much money on foundations that promised 'universal' shades," she laughs. "It took me three years of trial and error to realize Indian skin needs Indian solutions."

Today, Priya has personally tested over 600 makeup products, conducted shade-matching sessions for more than 12,000 women in cities from Delhi to Chennai, and built a reputation for honest, no-BS beauty advice. She's contributed to Femina and Vogue India, spoken at beauty conferences, and even collaborated with Nykaa on shade range expansions.

**What makes her different?** Priya doesn't just review products - she understands the science behind why certain formulas work (or don't) on Indian skin. Her background in chemistry helps her decode ingredient lists, while her experience as a working mom means she knows what "real women" need: makeup that lasts through Indian summers, doesn't break the bank, and enhances natural beauty without hiding it.

**Trust signals you can verify:**
- Featured in Vogue India's "Beauty Experts to Follow" (2023)
- Speaker at Beauty World Middle East (2024)
- Product tester for Lakmé and Sugar Cosmetics
- Regular contributor to Indian beauty forums with 50,000+ followers

**Important Disclaimer:** While I've helped thousands of women find their perfect makeup match, every person's skin is unique. What works beautifully for one person might not suit another due to individual skin chemistry, allergies, or sensitivities. The recommendations in this article are based on extensive testing and user feedback, but results can vary. Always patch test new products and consult a dermatologist for personalized skin concerns. This is not medical advice, and I'm not a doctor - just a passionate beauty enthusiast sharing what I've learned.
